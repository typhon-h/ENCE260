Game title: "Hole in the Wall"

Description: "Hole in the Wall" is a game in which the player (represented by a single moveable dot on the screen)
             has to dodge an unending series of walls which travel across the display at random directions.
             Each wall will have a hole within it, the size of this hole varies between 1 and 3 and is positioned randomly along
             the wall.

             There are 3 various gamemodes to choose from; "Push Wall", "Three Lives" or "Hardmode":


                  Three Lives - As the name suggests, the player begins the game with 3 lives. A life is lost for each time the
                                player collides with the wall. Game ends after 3 collisions
                                (note: collision is consisder wall moving into player, player can still move adjacent to wall)

                  Hardmode - Very much the same as "Three Lives", except the player only starts off with a single life, game ends
			 	  			 after just a single collision

                  Push Wall - Has the most resemblance to the game in which this is based off, the moving walls simply "pushes"
                              the character as the wall sweeps across the display. Game ends when player is pushed off the screen.

             PLayer can choose prefered gamemode at menu screen at the beginning.
             There is only a single wall on the display at any given moment, for each of the walls cleared the player gains a
             single point.

             As time progresses, the speed of these walls increases (progressively getting more difficult).



How to Play: - Upon running 'make program' you are greeted with the display prompt "Select Gamemode".
               Pressing down either the navswitch or button directs you to various gamemodes (as specified
               above), pressing down the navswitch allows you to scroll from one gamemode to the next. Once
			   at a gamemode press the button to select it and initiate the game.
             - Game descriptions are stated above, player is controlled by the navswitch direction inputs. Game
               continues until player death (once again, specified above)
             - You are then greeted with "Game Over", along with your score.
               To return to the initial game menu (to try another gamemode), press down the button
